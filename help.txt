***Roark Creek Commands***

[k]ey
	Enter a key to be used in encryption and decryption. It must be exactly 24 characters long and cannot contain spaces.

[g]enerate
	Randomly generate a key for use in encryption. It will be automatically set in place.

[e]ncrypt
	Enter some plaintext to encrypt. All standard keyboard characters are supported, plus a few extra.
	Make sure when you encrypt something that you keep your key safe and accessible to yourself.

[d]ecrypt
	Enter some ciphertext to decrypt. If the same key that was used to encrypt it is in place, the decrypted plaintext will be in the output. If not, you will see nonsense.

[s]nagFish
	Initiate a brute force attack on some ciphertext. SnagFish computes every possible key combination and attempts decryption with them one-by-one, checking the output for a given target phrase. If it finds the target, snagFish will stop and give you both the key and the decrypted output.
	Add option -v to see a verbose printout of each attempt as it's happening. Otherwise, snagFish will update you every 1000 keys with the average number of keys processed per second.

[f]lyFish
	Initiate a brute force attack on ciphertext limited to a specified number of attempts. Unlike snagFish, flyFish will not check the output any specific text. Instead, it prints each key guess and the decrypted output in a file called "flyFishLog.txt". After a flyFish task is complete, you may review the file for matches yourself.

[q]uit
	Exit Roark Creek. Any key in place will not be retained. 

[h]elp
	View this help file.
