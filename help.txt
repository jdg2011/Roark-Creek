***Roark Creek Commands***

[k]ey
	Enter a key to be used in encryption and decryption. It must be exactly 24 characters long and cannot contain spaces.

[g]enerate
	Randomly generate a key for use in encryption. It will be automatically set in place.

[e]ncrypt
	Enter some plaintext to encrypt. All standard keyboard characters are supported, plus a few extra.
	Make sure when you encrypt something that you keep your key safe and accessible to yourself.

[d]ecrypt
	Enter some ciphertext to decrypt. If the same key that was used to encrypt it is in place, the decrypted plaintext will be in the output. If not, you will see nonsense.

[s]nagFish
	Initiate a brute force attack on some ciphertext. SnagFish randomly generates keys, attempts decryption with them, and checks the output for a given target phrase. If it finds the target, snagFish will stop and give you both the key and the decrypted output.
	
	Add option -v to see a verbose printout of each attempt as it's happening.

[q]uit
	Exit Roark Creek. Any key in place will not be retained. 

[h]elp
	View this help file.
